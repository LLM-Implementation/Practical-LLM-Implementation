In our example, `State` is a `TypedDict` with one key: `messages`. The `add_messages` reducer function is used to append new messages to the list instead of overwriting it. Keys without a reducer annotation will overwrite previous values.

            "User: What do you know about LangGraph?\n",
            "Assistant: LangGraph is a library that extends the capabilities of LangChain by providing a way to build **robust and stateful multi-actor applications** using a **graph-based approach**.\n",
            "\n",
            "Essentially, while LangChain provides the building blocks (LLMs, tools, chains, agents), LangGraph gives you a powerful framework to **orchestrate complex sequences of operations, manage state, and handle intricate control flow**, especially for applications that require multiple steps, conditional logic, and iterative processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of what LangGraph is and what it offers:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Core Concepts\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **State:** At the heart of LangGraph is the concept of `State`. This is a shared object that gets passed between different nodes in your graph. Any node can read from or write to this state, allowing information to persist and evolve across multiple steps of your application. This is crucial for multi-turn conversations, agents that need to remember previous actions, or complex pipelines.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Nodes:** These are the individual units of work in your graph. A node can be:\n",
            "    *   An LLM call (e.g., to generate a response).\n",
            "    *   A tool invocation (e.g., searching the web, calling an API).\n",
            "    *   A custom Python function (e.g., processing data, making a decision).\n",
            "    *   Even another LangChain chain or agent.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Edges:** Edges define the transitions between nodes. They dictate how the execution flow moves from one node to the next.\n",
            "    *   **Direct Edges:** Unconditionally move from one node to another.\n",
            "    *   **Conditional Edges:** The most powerful type. They allow you to define transitions based on the *output* of a node. For example, if a node's output indicates a tool is needed, you can transition to a \"tool_executor\" node; otherwise, you might transition to a \"final_answer\" node.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Graphs and Cycles:** LangGraph allows you to define a directed graph, complete with entry and exit points. Crucially, it supports **cycles (loops)**. This is a significant differentiator from simple sequential chains, enabling:\n",
            "    *   **Self-correction:** An agent can try an action, observe the result, and if it's not satisfactory, loop back to a previous step to try again or refine its approach.\n",
            "    *   **Iterative refinement:** Repeating a process until a condition is met (e.g., generating code, testing it, and fixing errors until it works).\n",
            "    *   **Human-in-the-loop:** Pausing execution for human input or approval before proceeding.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Why Use LangGraph? (Key Advantages)\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Robust Orchestration:** Build highly resilient applications that can handle complex logic, errors, and conditional flows gracefully.\n",
            "*   **State Management:** Explicitly manage and pass state between steps, essential for multi-turn interactions and long-running processes.\n",
            "*   **Complex Agentic Behavior:** Ideal for building sophisticated LLM agents that can:\n",
            "    *   Reason and plan.\n",
            "    *   Use multiple tools.\n",
            "    *   Self-correct and iterate.\n",
            "    *   Engage in multi-step problem-solving.\n",
            "*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Easily integrate points where human intervention or approval is required.\n",
            "*   **Debugging and Visibility:** The graph structure makes it easier to visualize the flow, trace execution paths, and debug complex interactions.\n",
            "*   **Flexibility:** Nodes can be anything from simple functions to complex LangChain components, offering immense flexibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Relationship to LangChain\n",
            "\n",
            "LangGraph is built *on top of* LangChain and is considered an integral part of the LangChain ecosystem.\n",
            "*   **LangChain provides the primitives:** LLMs, Chains, Tools, Agents, Document Loaders, Retrievers, etc.\n",
            "*   **LangGraph provides the orchestration layer:** It takes these LangChain primitives and allows you to define how they interact in a structured, stateful, and often cyclical manner.\n",
            "\n",
            "You'll typically define your LLMs, tools, and potentially some simpler chains using LangChain, and then use LangGraph to wire them together into a sophisticated application flow.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Common Use Cases\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Advanced LLM Agents:** Creating agents that can plan, execute tools, observe results, and self-correct (e.g., a \"research agent\" that iteratively queries, summarizes, and refines its search).\n",
            "*   **Multi-turn Chatbots:** Building conversational AI that remembers context, handles complex user intents requiring multiple steps, and can clarify information.\n",
            "*   **Human-in-the-Loop Workflows:** Applications where an LLM generates a draft, but a human needs to review or approve it before the next step.\n",
            "*   **Complex Data Processing Pipelines:** Automating workflows that involve conditional data transformation, validation, and iterative refinement.\n",
            "*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Self-Correction:** A RAG system that, if an initial retrieval isn't sufficient, can re-query, re-rank, or refine its approach before generating a final answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, if you're building anything beyond a simple, linear LLM application and need to manage state, handle conditional logic, or enable iterative/self-correcting behavior, LangGraph is the tool in the LangChain ecosystem you'll want to leverage.\n"

This static schema allows nodes to rely on a consistent state format, ensuring seamless communication along edges throughout the graph.

This involves creating a template for the conversation, specifying the tools that the assistant will use, and configuring how the AI agent will respond to user input and trigger different functions (like calculating solar savings). Next, we define the tools that the assistant will use during the interaction, with the primary tool being compute_savings, which calculates potential savings based on the user's monthly electricity cost. By following these steps, you have successfully created an AI assistant using LangGraph that can calculate solar panel energy savings based on user inputs.\", \"score\": 0.7940821, \"raw_content\": null}], \"response_time\": 2.27}\n",

            "Building an autonomous agent with LangGraph often involves creating a multi-agent collaboration system. Here's a general approach based on the information available:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Define the Agent's State:** This involves setting up how the AI agent manages the ongoing context of the conversation or task. You'll need to define how it responds to user input and the output from its tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Define Tools:** Specify the tools that your agent will use to perform actions. These tools are essentially functions or modules that the agent can call upon. For example, a research assistant might have tools for browsing the web or analyzing data.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Design the Workflow (Graph):** LangGraph's core strength is its graph-based architecture. You'll define nodes (individual components or agents) and the relationships between them. For an autonomous research assistant, a workflow might include stages like:\n",
            "    *   Planning the research\n",
            "    *   Data collection and analysis\n",
            "    *   Review and revision\n",
            "    *   Writing the report\n",
            "    *   Publication\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Implement Agents:** For each stage or specific task, you might implement specialized agents. For instance, a \"browser\" agent, a \"planner\" agent, or a \"researcher\" agent, each with its own responsibilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Configure Responses and Triggers:** Configure how the AI agent will respond to user input and how it will trigger different functions or transitions between nodes in the graph.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these steps, you can create complex, long-running, and stateful AI agents using LangGraph.\n"
